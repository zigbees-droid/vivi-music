# Working with ViviMusic as an AI agent

ViviMusic is a 3rd party YouTube Music client written in Kotlin. It follows material 3 design guidelines closely.

## Rules for working on the project

1. Always pull the latest changes from `main` before starting your work to minimize merge conflicts.
2. Commit names should be clear and follow the format: `type(scope): short description`. For example: `feat(ui): add dark mode support`. Including the scope is optional.
3. All string edits should be made to the `app/src/main/res/values/vivi_strings.xml` file, NOT `app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml`. Do not touch other `strings.xml` or `vivi_strings.xml` files in the project. ONLY edit the default (English) `vivi_strings.xml` file, DO NOT EDIT OTHER LANGUAGES.
4. You are to follow best practices for Kotlin and Android development.
5. DO NOT EDIT THE APP'S DATABASE SCHEMA UNLESS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY.

## AI-only guidelines

1. You are strictly prohibited from making ANY changes to the readme/markdown files, including this one. This is to ensure that the documentation remains accurate and consistent for all contributors. This doesn't apply if you verify the changes with a human contributor.
2. Unless explicitly requested, you are not allowed to commit, push, or merge any changes to any branch. If you are explicitly requested and authorized to commit/push/merge, you have the right to do so; the responsibility then lies with the author who requested it.
   - You should absolutely NOT use any commands that would modify the git history, do force pushes (except for rebases on your own branch), or delete branches without explicit instructions from a human.
3. Comments should be added only for complex logic or non-obvious code. Avoid redundant comments that simply restate what the code does.
